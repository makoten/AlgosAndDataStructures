# Data Structures and Algorithms using C and C++

## Description

This repository contains code that I wrote while I was learning Data Structures and Algorithms 
using C and C++ by following the Udemy course [Abdul Bari - Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/).

This project was initialized with CLion and contains multiple executable files to make it easy to test and verify separately.
